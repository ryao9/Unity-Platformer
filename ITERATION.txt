The main feedback I received on my gold spike was to introduce the controls to the player somehow, work on wall jump physics, remove the ability to cling on to walls in certain cases, and to add onto the coin mechanic. I added images in the first level showing the controls as they were needed. I worked on wall physics to make wall jump smoother and more consistent and worked on getting rid of the bug where the player could cling on to walls. I also redesigned the first level to make the coin mechanic more prominent. I made it so that coins were optional and they had a bigger impact on the play through of the level. I then made a second level, introducing a new idea using the coin mechanic.
